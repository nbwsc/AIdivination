            <h2>Access and Use of the Service</h2>

                sound and other audio, photographs, graphics, messages, and other materials and mediums (collectively
                referred to as the "Submissions") and generate and return audio and visual output ("Output", and
                together with the Submissions, "Content"). The Service may include a public forum where Content can be
                shared in a productive environment with other users.</p>
            <p><strong>Your Registration Obligations:</strong> You may be required to register with Toolss or provide

                features of the Service. If you choose to register for the Service, you agree to provide and maintain
                true, accurate, current, and complete information about yourself as prompted by the Service's

                provide true, accurate, current, and complete information as requested by Toolss to confirm such express
                consent. You may not create more than one account to benefit from the free tier of the Service. If we
                believe you are not using the free tier in good faith, we may stop providing access to the Service. If
                we discontinue the Service, we will refund you any pre-paid fees on a pro rata basis, based upon the
                number of months left in the pre-payment period.</p>
            <p><strong>Member Account, Password and Security:</strong> You are responsible for maintaining the
                confidentiality of your password and account details, if any, and are fully responsible for any and all
                activities that occur under your password or account. You agree to (a) immediately notify Toolss of any
                unauthorized use of your password or account or any other breach of security, and (b) ensure that you
                exit from your account at the end of each session when accessing the Service. Toolss will not be liable
                for any loss or damage arising from your failure to comply with this paragraph.</p>
            <p><strong>Modifications to Service:</strong> Toolss reserves the right to modify or discontinue,
                temporarily
                or permanently, the Service (or any part thereof) with or without notice. You agree that Toolss will not
                be liable to you or to any third party for any modification, suspension or discontinuance of the
                Service.</p>
            <p><strong>General Practices Regarding Use and Storage:</strong> You acknowledge that Toolss may establish
                general practices and limits concerning use of the Service, including the maximum period of time that
                data or other content will be retained by the Service and the maximum storage space that will be
                allotted on Toolss's or its third-party service providers' servers on your behalf. You acknowledge that

            <h2>Conditions of Access and Use</h2>
            <p><strong>User Conduct:</strong> You are solely responsible for any use of the Service and all Submissions
                that you make available to Toolss, including by uploading, posting, publishing, or displaying
                (hereinafter, "upload(ing)") Submissions via the Service or by emailing or otherwise making available
                Submissions to other users of the Service. You assume all risk associated with Submissions, including
                the transmission thereof, and you have sole responsibility for the accuracy, quality, legality and
                appropriateness of Submissions. The posting of Content on the Service by users does not indicate any
                approval or endorsement by Toolss of such Content. Toolss is not responsible for, and disclaims, any and
                all
                liability in connection with Content or any act of accessing, browsing, contributing to or otherwise
                using the Service. In no event will you use the Output to compete with Toolss, including to create a
                competing product or service. The list below provides examples of the kinds of Submissions or uses that
                are illegal or prohibited by Toolss. Toolss reserves the right to investigate and take appropriate legal
                action against anyone who, in Toolss's sole discretion, violates this provision, including removing the
                offending content from the Service, suspending or terminating the account of such violators, and
                reporting the violator to law enforcement authorities. You agree to not use the Service to:</p>

            <p>If you are blocked by Toolss from accessing the Service (including by blocking your IP address), you
                agree
                not to implement any measures to circumvent such blocking (e.g., by masking your IP address or using a
                proxy IP address or virtual private network).</p>
            <p><strong>Fees:</strong> To the extent the Service or any portion thereof is made available for any fee,
                you may be required to select a payment plan and provide information regarding your credit card or other
                payment instrument. You represent and warrant to Toolss that such information is true and that you are
                authorized to use the payment instrument. You will promptly update your account information with Toolss
                or
                the Payment Processor (as defined below), as applicable, of any changes (for example, a change in your
                billing address or credit card expiration date) that may occur. You agree to pay Toolss the amount that
                is
                specified in the payment plan in accordance with the terms of such plan and these Terms of Service. If
                your payment plan includes an ongoing subscription that is automatically renewed periodically, you
                hereby authorize Toolss (through the Payment Processor) to bill your payment instrument in advance on
                such
                periodic basis in accordance with the terms of the applicable payment plan until you terminate your
                account, and you further agree to pay any charges so incurred. If you dispute any charges you must let
                Toolss know within sixty (60) days after the date that Toolss charges you, or within such longer period
                of
                time as may be required under applicable law. Details on our free and paid subscription offerings,
                including prices for paid subscriptions, are listed at <a

                change Toolss's prices. If Toolss does change prices, Toolss will provide notice of the change through
                the
                Service user interface, a pop-up notice, email, or through other reasonable means, at Toolss's option,
                at
                least fifteen (15) days before the change is to take effect. Your continued use of the Service after the
                price change becomes effective constitutes your agreement to pay the changed amount. You will be
                responsible for all taxes associated with the Service, other than taxes based on Toolss's net income.

            <p><strong>Content:</strong> You represent and warrant that you own all right, title and interest in and to
                Submissions, including all copyrights and rights of publicity contained therein, and that you possess
                all necessary rights or have obtained all consents necessary to grant Toolss the rights and licenses
                herein. By using the Service or otherwise transmitting Submissions to us, you grant to Toolss and our
                affiliates, successors, assigns, and designees a worldwide, non-exclusive, fully paid-up, sublicensable

                display, communicate, transmit and otherwise make available any and all Content (in whole or in part) in

                promotion, marketing, and improvement of our products and services, including the Service. For the
                avoidance of doubt, this license authorizes us to make your Content available to and sublicense Content
                to other users of the Service as necessary to provide the Service, and you further grant to Toolss the
                worldwide, fully paid-up, sublicensable, assignable, perpetual and irrevocable right to identify to the
                public (both on and off the Service) that Output (or any of it) was generated via the Service. Such
                additional uses by Toolss and other users of the Service is made without compensation to you or any
                other
                provider of the Submissions with respect to the Content, as the use of the Service by you is hereby
                agreed as being sufficient compensation for the Content and grant of rights herein. Furthermore, and for
                the avoidance of doubt, you irrevocably waive any and all so-called "moral rights" or "droit moral" that
                may exist in or in connection with the Content. You acknowledge that to the extent that you include
                personally identifiable information in the Submissions, we may republish such information. Although
                Toolss
                has no obligation to monitor the Content, you acknowledge and agree that we may do one or all of the
                following: (i) monitor the Content; (ii) alter, edit, or remove any Content in whole or in part; or
                (iii) disclose any Content.</p>
            <p>Subject to your compliance with the terms of this Agreement, if you are a user who has subscribed to the
                paid tier of the Service, Toolss hereby assigns to you all of its right, title and interest in and to
                any
                Output owned by Toolss and generated from Submissions made by you through the Service during the term of
                your paid-tier subscription. If you are a user of the free tier of the Service then, as between you and
                Toolss, Toolss owns all Output generated from Submissions made by you through the Service, and, subject
                to
                your compliance with the terms of this Agreement, Toolss grants you a license to use such Output solely
                for your lawful, internal, and non-commercial purposes, provided that you give attribution credit to
                Toolss in each case.</p>
            <p>For the avoidance of doubt, Output may be publicly available in a third party application such as
                Discord, where it may be viewable, downloadable, and modified by other users of that third party
                application. If the Output becomes publicly available in such third-party application, you agree that
                other users have a right to access, display, view, store, modify, and copy such Output; provided,
                however, that you may change your settings to bypass these public sharing default settings so that
                Output generated will remain private.</p>
            <p>Due to the nature of machine learning, Output may not be unique across users and the Service may generate
                the same or similar output for a third party. Other users may provide similar submissions and receive
                the same output. Output that is requested by and generated for other users is not your Content.</p>
            <p>You hereby authorize Toolss and its third-party service providers to derive statistical and usage data
                relating to your use of the Service ("Usage Data"). We may use Usage Data for any purpose in accordance
                with applicable law and our Privacy Policy.</p>

                ("Feedback") provided by you to Toolss are non-confidential, and Toolss will be entitled to the

                use and dissemination of Feedback for any purpose, commercial or otherwise, without acknowledgment,
                attribution, or compensation to you.</p>
            <p>You acknowledge and agree that Toolss may preserve Content and may also disclose Content if required to
                do
                so by law or in the good faith belief that such preservation or disclosure is reasonably necessary to:
                (a) comply with legal process, applicable laws, or government requests; (b) enforce these Terms of
                Service; (c) respond to claims that any content violates the rights of third parties; or (d) protect the
                rights, property, or personal safety of Toolss, its users, or the public. You understand that the
                technical processing and transmission of the Service, including Content, may involve (i) transmissions
                over various networks; and (ii) changes to conform and adapt to technical requirements of connecting
                networks or devices.</p>
            <p><strong>Copyright Complaints:</strong> Toolss respects the intellectual property of others, and we ask
                our
                users to do the same. If you believe that your work has been copied in a way that constitutes copyright

                <li>identification of the content that is claimed to be infringing or to be the subject of infringing
                    activity, and where the content that you claim is infringing is located on the Service, with enough
                    detail that we may find it on the Service;</li>
                <li>your address, telephone number, and email address;</li>
                <li>a statement by you that you have a good faith belief that the disputed use is not authorized by the

                <li>a statement by you that the information in your notice is accurate and, under penalty of perjury,
                    that you are the copyright or intellectual property owner or are authorized to act on the behalf of
                    the owner of the copyright or intellectual property that is allegedly infringed.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><em><strong>Counter-Notice:</strong></em> If you believe that your Content that was removed (or to which
                access was disabled) is not infringing, or that you have the authorization from the copyright owner, the
                copyright owner's agent, or pursuant to the law, to upload and use the content in Content, you may send
                a written counter-notice containing the following information to the Copyright Agent:</p>

                <li>a statement by you, made under penalty of perjury, that you have a good faith belief that the
                    content was removed or disabled as a result of mistake or a misidentification of the content to be
                    removed or disabled; and</li>
                <li>your name, address, telephone number, and email address, a statement that you consent to the

            </ul>
            <p>If a counter-notice is received by the Copyright Agent, Toolss will send a copy of the counter-notice to
                the original complaining party informing them that Toolss may replace the removed content or cease
                disabling it within ten (10) business days. Unless the owner of the applicable copyrighted work or other
                intellectual property files an action seeking a court order against Toolss or the user, the removed
                content may be replaced, or access to it restored, within ten (10) to fourteen (14) business days or
                more after receipt of the counter-notice, at our sole discretion.</p>
            <p><em><strong>Repeat Infringer Policy:</strong></em> In accordance with the DMCA and other applicable law,
                Toolss has adopted a policy of terminating, in appropriate circumstances and at Toolss's sole
                discretion,
                the accounts of users who are deemed to be repeat infringers. Toolss may also at its sole discretion
                limit
                access to the Service and/or terminate the accounts of any users who infringe any intellectual property
                rights of others, whether or not there is any repeat infringement.</p>

            <p>This Dispute Resolution by Binding Arbitration section is referred to in these Terms of Service as the
                "Arbitration Agreement." You agree that any and all disputes or claims that have arisen or may arise
                between you and Toolss, whether arising out of or relating to these Terms of Service (including any
                alleged breach thereof), the Service, any advertising, or any aspect of the relationship or transactions
                between us, will be resolved exclusively through final and binding arbitration, rather than a court, in

                from bringing issues to the attention of federal, state, or local agencies, and such agencies can, if
                the law allows, seek relief against us on your behalf. You agree that, by entering into these Terms of
                Service, you and Toolss are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class
                action.
                Your rights will be determined by a neutral arbitrator, not a judge or jury. The Federal Arbitration Act
                governs the interpretation and enforcement of this Arbitration Agreement.</p>

                party who intends to seek arbitration must first send to the other, by certified mail, a written Notice
                of Dispute ("Notice"). The Notice to Toolss should be sent to 17 Dunster Street, Floor 4, Cambridge, MA
                02138 ("Notice Address"). The Notice must (i) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute and
                (ii) set forth the specific relief sought. If Toolss and you do not resolve the claim within sixty (60)
                calendar days after the Notice is received, you or Toolss may commence an arbitration proceeding. During
                the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by Toolss or you will not be disclosed to the
                arbitrator until after the arbitrator determines the amount, if any, to which you or Toolss is entitled.

            <ol start="4">
                <li><strong>Arbitration Procedures</strong></li>
            </ol>
            <p>Arbitration will be conducted by a neutral arbitrator in accordance with the American Arbitration
                Association's ("AAA") rules and procedures, including the AAA's Consumer Arbitration Rules
                (collectively, the "AAA Rules"), as modified by this Arbitration Agreement. For information on the AAA,
                please visit its website, https://www.adr.org. Information about the AAA Rules and fees for consumer
                disputes can be found at the AAA's consumer arbitration page, https://www.adr.org/consumer. If there is
                any inconsistency between any term of the AAA Rules and any term of this Arbitration Agreement, the
                applicable terms of this Arbitration Agreement will control unless the arbitrator determines that the
                application of the inconsistent Arbitration Agreement terms would not result in a fundamentally fair
                arbitration. The arbitrator must also follow the provisions of these Terms of Service as a court would.
                All issues are for the arbitrator to decide, including issues relating to the scope, enforceability, and
                arbitrability of this Arbitration Agreement. Although arbitration proceedings are usually simpler and
                more streamlined than trials and other judicial proceedings, the arbitrator can award the same damages
                and relief on an individual basis that a court can award to an individual under these Terms of Service
                and applicable law. Decisions by the arbitrator are enforceable in court and may be overturned by a
                court only for very limited reasons.</p>
            <p>Unless Toolss and you agree otherwise, any arbitration hearings will take place in a reasonably
                convenient
                location for both parties with due consideration of their ability to travel and other pertinent
                circumstances. If the parties are unable to agree on a location, the determination will be made by AAA.
                If your claim is for $10,000 or less, Toolss agrees that you may choose whether the arbitration will be
                conducted solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator, through a telephonic hearing, or
                by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules. If your claim exceeds $10,000, the right to a
                hearing will be determined by the AAA Rules. Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is
                conducted, the arbitrator will issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential
                findings and conclusions on which the award is based.</p>
            <ol start="5">
                <li><strong>Costs of Arbitration</strong></li>
            </ol>
            <p>Payment of all filing, administration, and arbitrator fees (collectively, the "Arbitration Fees") will be
                governed by the AAA Rules, unless otherwise provided in this Arbitration Agreement. To the extent any
                Arbitration Fees are not specifically allocated to either Toolss or you under the AAA Rules, Toolss and
                you
                shall split them equally; provided that if you are able to demonstrate to the arbitrator that you are
                economically unable to pay your portion of such Arbitration Fees or if the arbitrator otherwise
                determines for any reason that you should not be required to pay your portion of any Arbitration Fees,
                Toolss will pay your portion of such fees. In addition, if you demonstrate to the arbitrator that the
                costs of arbitration will be prohibitive as compared to the costs of litigation, Toolss will pay as much
                of the Arbitration Fees as the arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the arbitration from being
                cost-prohibitive. Any payment of attorneys' fees will be governed by the AAA Rules.</p>
            <ol start="6">
                <li><strong>Confidentiality</strong></li>
            </ol>

                strictly confidential for the benefit of all parties.</p>

                <li><strong>Severability</strong></li>
            </ol>

                the subsection (b) above titled "Prohibition of Class and Representative Actions and Non-Individualized
                Relief" above) is invalid or unenforceable, the parties agree to replace such term or provision with a
                term or provision that is valid and enforceable and that comes closest to expressing the intention of
                the invalid or unenforceable term or provision, and this Arbitration Agreement will be enforceable as so
                modified. If a court or the arbitrator decides that any of the provisions of subsection (b) above titled
                "Prohibition of Class and Representative Actions and Non-Individualized Relief" are invalid or
                unenforceable, then the entirety of this Arbitration Agreement will be null and void, unless such
                provisions are deemed to be invalid or unenforceable solely with respect to claims for public injunctive
                relief. The remainder of these Terms of Service will continue to apply.</p>

                any
                future change to this Arbitration Agreement (other than a change to the Notice Address) while you are a
                user of the Service, you may reject any such change by sending Toolss written notice within thirty (30)
                calendar days of the change to the Notice Address provided above. By rejecting any future change, you
                are agreeing that you will arbitrate any dispute between us in accordance with the language of this
                Arbitration Agreement as of the date you first accepted these Terms of Service (or accepted any
                subsequent changes to these Terms of Service).</p>
            <h2>Termination</h2>
            <p>You agree that Toolss, in its sole discretion, may suspend or terminate your account (or any part
                thereof)
                or use of the Service and remove and discard any content within the Service, for any reason, including
                for lack of use or if Toolss believes that you have violated or acted inconsistently with the letter or
                spirit of these Terms of Service. Any suspected fraudulent, abusive, or illegal activity that may be
                grounds for termination of your use of the Service, may be referred to appropriate law enforcement
                authorities. Toolss may also in its sole discretion and at any time discontinue providing the Service,
                or
                any part thereof, with or without notice. You agree that any termination of your access to the Service
                under any provision of these Terms of Service may be effected without prior notice, and acknowledge and
                agree that Toolss may immediately deactivate or delete your account and all related information and
                files
                in your account and/or bar any further access to such files or the Service. Further, you agree that
                Toolss
                will not be liable to you or any third party for any termination of your access to the Service.</p>
            <h2>User Disputes</h2>
            <p>You agree that you are solely responsible for your interactions with any other user in connection with
                the Service, and Toolss will have no liability or responsibility with respect thereto. Toolss reserves
                the
                right, but has no obligation, to become involved in any way with disputes between you and any other user
                of the Service.</p>
            <h2>General</h2>
            <p>These Terms of Service (together with the terms incorporated by reference herein) constitute the entire
                agreement between you and Toolss governing your access and use of the Service, and supersede any prior
                agreements between you and Toolss with respect to the Service. You also may be subject to additional
                terms
                and conditions that may apply when you use Third-Party Services, third-party content or third-party
                software. These Terms of Service will be governed by the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts
                without regard to its conflict of law provisions. With respect to any disputes or claims not subject to
                arbitration, as set forth above, you and Toolss submit to the personal and exclusive jurisdiction of the
                state and federal courts located within Massachusetts. The failure of Toolss to exercise or enforce any
                right or provision of these Terms of Service will not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. If
                any provision of these Terms of Service is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, the
                parties nevertheless agree that the court should endeavor to give effect to the parties' intentions as
                reflected in the provision, and the other provisions of these Terms of Service remain in full force and
                effect. You agree that regardless of any statute or law to the contrary, any claim or cause of action
                arising out of or related to use of the Service or these Terms of Service must be filed within one (1)
                year after such claim or cause of action arose or be forever barred. A printed version of these Terms of
                Service and of any notice given in electronic form will be admissible in judicial or administrative
                proceedings based upon or relating to these Terms of Service to the same extent and subject to the same
                conditions as other business documents and records originally generated and maintained in printed form.
                You may not assign these Terms of Service without the prior written consent of Toolss, but Toolss may
                assign
                or transfer these Terms of Service, in whole or in part, without restriction. The section titles in
                these Terms of Service are for convenience only and have no legal or contractual effect. As used in
                these Terms of Service, the words "include" and "including," and variations thereof, will not be deemed
                to be terms of limitation, but rather will be deemed to be followed by the words "without limitation."
                Notices to you may be made via either email or regular mail. The Service may also provide notices to you
                of changes to these Terms of Service or other matters by displaying notices or links to notices
                generally on the Service. Toolss will not be in default hereunder by reason of any failure or delay in
                the
                performance of its obligations where such failure or delay is due to civil disturbances, riot, epidemic,
                hostilities, war, terrorist attack, embargo, natural disaster, acts of God, flood, fire, sabotage,
                fluctuations or unavailability of electrical power, network access or equipment, or any other
                circumstances or causes beyond Toolss's reasonable control.</p>
