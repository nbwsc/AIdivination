            <h2>Payment Processing</h2>
            <p>We utilize third-party service providers that act as resellers of, and/or payment processors for the fees
                payable for, licenses to certain of our Services and/or content that may be purchased through our
                websites (each, a "Payment Processor"). In order to purchase such Services through our website, you will
                be required to provide credit/debit card and/or financial institution account information directly to
                the Payment Processor. Such information is not collected or stored by us, and the Payment Processor's
                Privacy Notice will apply to all information that you provide to the Payment Processor through the
                purchase and payment process or otherwise. We will not be responsible for any act or omission of any
                Payment Processor, including any failure of the Payment Processor to comply with its Privacy Notice or
                any other terms and conditions governing its resale of licenses or payment processing.</p>
